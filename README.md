# Introduction

Use matlab. 

In the **code** folder, there are code and the resource for Lab experiments.

In the **coursework** foler, there are steps and instructions for doing experiments and answering questions.

As for the courses, it also has a link for [lesson notes(click here)](https://celiachien.github.io/categories/Computer-Vision/).
